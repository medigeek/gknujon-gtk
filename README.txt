Hours of searching lead to frustration, frustration leads to overdue creation, creation leads to the dark side of the spam.  die spam, die (it's german ;-) )

BlueFrog is dead.  Okopipi doesn't produce mucho.  But knujon actually wants all of our junkmail and tells us the spammers' days are counted. My GMail-account catches a lot of spam, yet there was no easy way to report tons of spam in the spam folder of my gmail account. Python, libgmail and a bucket full of persistence, not solely my own, gave birth to this script.

You 'll need to install Python to run this script.
python: http://www.python.org/

This is basically the same script as gknujon, except that it only reports 48hrs old spam, instead of doing a lot of filtering and putting it all in one script I decided to split them up.  Since I figured there must be a lot of knujon users who don't use spamcop and/or vice versa.

Mail any suggestions to rainwolf@submanifold.be, 
have fun
